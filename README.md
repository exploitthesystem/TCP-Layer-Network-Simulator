# TCP-Layer-Network-Simulator
Alternating bit and go-back-N implementations of a transport layer protocol.

Implemented in Python 2.7.

The TCP simulators depend on support files that simulate network infrastructure.
These are implied in the code, but they are not included, as they do not represent
the original work of the author.
